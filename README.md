# Frog-Microhabitat-Classification

Frog populations are declining all around the world. As species disappear we also lose the ability to study their ecology and behavior.
Therefore, it is important to find ways to extract ecological data even if a species is rare or extinct. 
My model here is attempting to accomplish this by taking in morphological data from live and museum specimens and predicting the microhabitat of frogs.
